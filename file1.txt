You children will be the future of this country.
They will write the letter to their best friend.
I will read the newspaper when I go to bus station.
Tomorrow, the sun will rise at 6:00 am.
They will be here in two hours.
Will you come to the party?
When will you travel?
You can’t carry this luggage yourself. I will help you.
I am going to cook tonight.
It won’t be very cold next week.
